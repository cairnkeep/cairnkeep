# Cairnkeep

> A durable, harness-agnostic **memory + context layer** for coding agents.

A *cairn* is a stack of stones left as a trail marker for whoever follows; a
*keep* is where you store what matters. **Cairnkeep** is where coding agents
stack durable memory — decisions, pitfalls, patterns — and follow the trail
across sessions, projects, and harnesses (Claude Code, OpenCode, …).

## Status

Shipped: the memory server, the `cairn` CLI (`bootstrap`, `memory-server`, `sync`,
`doctor`, `memory`, `audit-timer`, `uninstall`) installable via `npm i -g @cairnkeep/cli`, and the
operating layer (commands,
agents, hooks) installed on both Claude Code and OpenCode. The generic launchers
expose wrapper seams (`.ai/pre-launch.sh`, `CAIRN_EXTRA_SETTINGS`,
`.ai/post-exit.sh`) so an enterprise wrapper can add provider/credential setup
without forking them. Also shipped: context exploration (`/context-explore`) and
a thin routing seam (`route_check`), both of which delegate to
[token-miser](https://github.com/cairnkeep/token-miser), a public
cairnkeep-org sibling project.

## Components

- **`mcp-memory-server/`** — an MCP server exposing durable, scoped memory
  (`memory_write`, `memory_search`, …) backed by AgentFS, with optional
  embedding-ranked search against any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- **`bin/cairn`** — the CLI. `cairn bootstrap [path]` scaffolds a project's
  `.ai/` launchers + env; `cairn doctor` health-checks the configured pieces;
  `cairn memory export|import` relocates the durable store between machines
  (`export` requires the optional `sqlite3` CLI);
  `cairn audit-timer` installs the scheduled memory+wiki audit; `cairn uninstall`
  reverses the install (backup-first, revertible).
- **`templates/`** — project scaffolding (generic launchers, env) plus the
  derived-knowledge layer (wiki, alignment, graph, security, planning).
- **`scripts/`** — asset-sync and maintenance utilities.

## Related projects

- **[token-miser](https://github.com/cairnkeep/token-miser)** — a public
  cairnkeep-org sibling that owns context exploration and request routing;
  cairnkeep's `context_explore` and `route_check` tools are thin delegates
  to it.

## Optional companion tools

cairnkeep runs standalone — none of the tools below are required. Its memory
server, `cairn bootstrap`, and derived-knowledge features work with none of
them. These are the accelerators the author pairs cairnkeep with; each is opt-in.

| Tool | What it adds | How it plugs in |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| [lean-ctx](https://github.com/yvgude/lean-ctx) | Compressed reads/searches/shell/dir-maps — large token savings on exploration | Register as an MCP server in your harness |
| [token-miser](https://github.com/cairnkeep/token-miser) | Model routing (`route_check`) + codebase mapping (`context_explore`) | Already integrated, env-gated: `CAIRN_ROUTE_ENDPOINT` / `CAIRN_EXPLORE_BINARY` |
| [rtk](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) | "Rust Token Killer": token-reduced proxy for git/npm/cargo output | Shell-level, no wiring needed |

## Setup

A working workflow needs three things: the memory server registered, the
operating layer (commands, agents, hooks) installed into your harness, and a
bootstrapped project. `cairn bootstrap` does only the last of these — the full
ordered walkthrough is in **[docs/operating.md](docs/operating.md)**.

This setup is local by default: the registered stdio server stores memory on
the user's computer. Cairnkeep never discovers or selects a remote host.
Remote HTTP storage requires an explicit server deployment and client URL; see
**[Memory storage and deployment](docs/storage.md)** before enabling it.

The short version for Claude Code:

```bash
# 1. Install cairnkeep and register the memory server (server name: cairn-memory)
npm install -g @cairnkeep/cli
claude mcp add cairn-memory -s user -- cairn memory-server

# 2. Install the operating layer (commands, agents, hooks, scaffold templates)
cairn sync --apply                       # add --live-root <proj>/.claude to scope it

# 3. Scaffold a project and configure it
cairn bootstrap /path/to/project
cp /path/to/project/.ai/env.example /path/to/project/.ai/.env   # then edit

# 4. Launch (and, optionally, check the wiring first)
cd /path/to/project && cairn doctor
./.ai/start-claude.sh
```

Prefer working from a clone? Build the server with `cd mcp-memory-server && npm
install && npm run build`, then use `scripts/sync-claude-assets.sh` and
`bin/cairn` in place of the installed `cairn`.

Step 2 is easy to miss and load-bearing: without it the memory server is
registered but none of the `/remember`, `/recall`, `/wiki-*`, `/security-audit`,
or `/repo-review` commands (and no memory hooks) exist. OpenCode uses the
`sync-opencode-*.sh` scripts instead — see the operating guide.

The launchers load `.ai/.env` and start the harness in the repo root. They stay
deliberately minimal — provider/profile specifics belong in your own wrapper,
which plugs in through the launcher seams below.

**Wrapper seams.** The generic launchers are no-ops beyond loading `.ai/.env`
unless a wrapper opts in:

- **`.ai/pre-launch.sh`** — sourced after `.env`, before the harness starts. May
  export env (e.g. a provider base URL) or abort the launch by returning
  non-zero. This is where credential refresh / connectivity setup lives.
- **`CAIRN_EXTRA_SETTINGS`** — path to a settings file layered onto the harness
  (`--settings` for Claude Code, `--config` for OpenCode). Process env still
  wins, so an inline value beats the profile.
- **`.ai/post-exit.sh`** — sourced after the harness exits, with
  `CAIRN_EXIT_STATUS` set to its exit code.

**Contributor mode.** Working on a repo you don't own? `cairn bootstrap
--untracked /path/to/project` additionally writes the scaffolded paths
(`.ai/`, `.planning/`, `.agentfs/`) into the repo's `.git/info/exclude`, so the workflow
files stay purely local: nothing to commit or push, invisible to every other
contributor, and no edit to the shared `.gitignore`. The trade-off is that
untracked planning state lives only on that clone — deleting the clone
deletes it. To move the durable memory itself between machines, use
`cairn memory export` / `cairn memory import`.

## Configuration

The memory server and collaboration commands are configured entirely through
`.ai/.env` (any OpenAI-compatible API for extraction and embedding-ranked
search):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CAIRN_LLM_API_KEY` | API key for the extraction / embeddings endpoint |
| `CAIRN_LLM_API_URL` | Base URL of the OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| `CAIRN_LLM_EXTRACTION_MODEL` | Chat model used for memory extraction |
| `CAIRN_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_URL` | Embeddings endpoint (falls back to `CAIRN_LLM_API_URL`) |
| `CAIRN_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | Embedding model name (required for semantic search) |
| `CAIRN_AGENTFS_BASE_DIR` | Base dir for global memory scopes (default `~/.cairnkeep`) |
| `CAIRN_GIT_PROVIDER` | Git host for collaboration commands: `github`\|`gitlab`\|`codeberg`\|`forgejo`\|`none` ([docs/git-providers.md](docs/git-providers.md)) |
| `CAIRN_ROUTE_ENDPOINT` | Base URL of an already-running token-miser routing/tiering proxy (unset → `route_check` is inert) |
| `CAIRN_EXPLORE_BINARY` | Absolute path to the `token_miser` binary used by `context_explore` (unset → the tool throws) |
| `CAIRN_EXPLORE_REPO_ROOT` | Default repo root for `context_explore` when no per-call `repo_root` is given |
| `CAIRN_EXTRA_SETTINGS` | Optional settings/config file the launcher layers onto the harness (wrapper seam) |
| `CAIRN_ANYTHINGLLM_SYNC_SCRIPT` | Override path to the domain-knowledge sync script (when the integration lives outside the repo) |

Without an API key, search degrades gracefully to substring matching.
