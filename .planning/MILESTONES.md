# Milestones

## v1.3 Routing Seam & Context Maturation (Shipped: 2026-07-08)

**Delivered:** A thin, frozen routing seam to token-miser, a self-consistent public story (token-miser live as a public sibling, zero-drift docs, guard-verified hygiene), a matured `context_explore` (cached, memory/wiki-aware, auto-invoked), and a headless OpenCode harness that reproduces the `/remember`→`/recall` round-trip reliably — closing the v1.1 OCP-06 gap.

**Stats:** 4 phases (10–13), 12 plans, 29 tasks · 128 commits (`a817f26`→`0305bcd`) · 78 files changed, +12,440/−177 · 3 days (2026-07-06 → 2026-07-08)
**Closeout:** verified_closeout — 9/9 requirements satisfied, audit passed (`milestones/v1.3-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`), all human-check items closed in UAT.

**Key accomplishments:**

- `route_check` routing seam (RT-01/02): a thin fetch-based MCP delegate probing token-miser's `GET /health`, fail-closed on every network/status/parse error, proven by an offline MCP round-trip guard plus a real-binary proof script, with the `CAIRN_ROUTE_ENDPOINT` seam contract frozen in `docs/operating.md`.
- token-miser published as a public cairnkeep-org sibling (SC-01): github.com/cairnkeep/token-miser is live and PUBLIC — scrubbed, Apache-2.0, single-clean-commit tree that passed the guard and `cargo build` before push.
- Two fail-loud hygiene gates (SC-02/03): a three-stage no-private-references guard (tree, env-gated denylist, commit-log) and a docs-vs-code parity checker — both run live against the final tree and recorded as the milestone gate.
- `context_explore` matured (CTX-08/09/10): content-sensitive result cache keyed on (query, HEAD, dirty-state), citations cross-referenced against project memory and the wiki (byte-identical zero-hit output), and a double-opt-in fail-open `UserPromptSubmit` hook auto-invoking exploration pre-task — all proven by the composed `verify-explore-maturation.sh` gate.
- Headless harness hardened (OCP-07): genuine NDJSON tool-event assertions replace substring greps, both round-trip halves run via `opencode serve`/`--attach` with infra-only retry, and a preflight-gated `--repeat 5` soak passed 5/5 consecutive live round-trips against qwen3.5-27b — resolving the v1.1 OCP-06 headless-reproduction gap.

## v1.3 Routing Seam & Context Maturation — Phase 11 self-consistency gate

**Run date:** 2026-07-06

Phase 11 (SC-01/SC-02/SC-03) capstone gate, run live against the final tree
after the Plan 03 docs sweep and the Plan 01 guard/Plan 02 publish work:

- `scripts/verify-no-private-references.sh` run with `CAIRN_GUARD_DENYLIST` set
  (operator specific-term list) — exited 0: `[guard] OK: no private/vendor/
  AI-authorship references found in tracked tree or commit-message history`

- `scripts/verify-docs-parity.sh` — exited 0: `[env-keys] OK: every
  mcp-memory-server/src env key is named in docs/operating.md or README.md`,
  `[commands] OK: every claude/commands/*.md command is named in
  docs/operating.md`, `[parity] OK: docs match shipped code -- no drift found`

- `gh repo view cairnkeep/token-miser --json visibility` — `{"visibility":
  "PUBLIC"}`

SC-01/SC-02/SC-03 evidence triad recorded together. This is a phase-gate
record, not a v1.3 shipped-milestone section — Phases 12-13 remain open.

## v1.2 Context Exploration (Shipped: 2026-07-06)

**Phases completed:** 4 phases, 8 plans, 18 tasks

**Key accomplishments:**

- Committed bash+curl+jq probe (`scripts/verify-fastcontext-reliability.sh`) with an offline `--self-test` that proves the /props recording, the strict per-turn tool-call gate, and the refined-D-05 verdict logic — all before any live endpoint is touched.
- The operator ran the committed probe live against the actually-deployed FastContext q8_0 GGUF + `llama-server --jinja` endpoint; the go/no-go verdict is GO — every turn of the ≥15-turn matrix emitted a real `tool_calls` array (15/15, exit 0, zero narration), de-risking the OCP-04 failure class and opening Phases 7-9.
- Offline, fail-closed smoke guard + four fake-tokenmiser fixtures for `context_explore`, wired into `test:smoke` — intentionally RED at the tool-registration anchor until Plan 02 lands the tool.
- Registered `context_explore` as a thin subprocess-delegating MCP tool that shells out to `token_miser explore`, resolves `repo_root` to an absolute path, fails closed on every precondition/execution error, and renders compact `path:line-range` citations alongside a lossless structured `Evidence` passthrough.
- Paired `/context-explore` slash commands for Claude Code and OpenCode that call the Phase 7 `context_explore` MCP tool directly and relay its compact citations, with no auto-read of cited ranges.
- Dedicated `scripts/sync-opencode-explore-assets.sh` install/drift script plus `docs/operating.md` parity, giving the OpenCode `/context-explore` command the same install path as its five sibling assets (CTX-05).
- Committed `scripts/verify-token-savings-ab.sh` — a staged, env-driven, loopback-only harness that computes the native-grep-and-read vs `context_explore` citation-text byte/char delta deterministically, with an offline `--self-test` Nyquist backstop and a fail-loud operator-gated live `--explore` stage.
- Measured cairnkeep's own byte/token-savings number live against the real FastContext backend: 99.9%+ byte-savings on verified pinpoint queries, with the harness's broad default query set transparently flagged as a D-01 model-reliability gap rather than a hidden pass.

## v1.1 OpenCode parity (Shipped: 2026-07-04)

**Phases completed:** 2 phases (4-5), 9 plans, 19 tasks
**Requirements:** 6/6 mapped — OCP-01/02/03/05 proven live; OCP-04/06 proven-achievable with an open reliability gap (see Known Gaps)
**Baseline tag:** `v1.1` (annotated, at HEAD)
**Closeout:** override_closeout — Phase 5 (OCP-06) shipped without a green verified closeout; the round-trip is proven achievable but not reliably reproducible headless (see Known Gaps)
**Git range:** `v1.0.0..v1.1` — 58 commits, 48 files, +6505/−155

**Delivered:** OpenCode reaches the Claude Code operating-layer baseline — the memory-capture (session-end) and memory-recall (pre-edit) lifecycle plus `remember`/`recall` commands ported to OpenCode's native plugin model, a self-sufficient session-start wakeup that no longer shells out to `~/.claude`, and a scratch-isolated live-parity harness that proves each stage against the registered `cairn-memory` MCP.

**Key accomplishments:**

- Confirmed experimental.chat.system.transform reaches the model in OpenCode v1.17.11, so OCP-05's wakeup rewrite keeps its existing injection mechanism instead of falling back to an instruction-file channel.
- Rewrote `opencode/plugins/memory-wakeup.ts` to surface AgentFS memory, the wiki index, open HARD contradictions, and staged-candidates count natively, removing the last `~/.claude` shell-out from the OpenCode wakeup path.
- `opencode/plugins/memory-capture.ts` extracts memory candidates on OpenCode session-end (`session.idle`, subagent-filtered, deduped) and stages them to `.planning/memory-staging/` byte-compatible with the Claude `memory-capture.sh` contract.
- `opencode/plugins/memory-recall.ts` blocks-and-surfaces file-specific AgentFS/wiki context before an OpenCode edit or write proceeds, using the confirmed `output.args.filePath` field and a throw-to-surface mechanism with a once-per-file-per-session guard.
- sync-opencode-plugin-assets.sh now renders @@INFRA_ROOT@@ and installs all three native plugins idempotently; the OCP-05 hard bar (wakeup surfaces AgentFS memory with no reachable ~/.claude) is proven by a live scratch-HOME acceptance run.
- session.idle confirmed live (v1.17.11) to fire exactly once per `opencode run`, always after real messages exist, plus the `sessionID` JSON field name — de-risking 05-02's capture and remember->recall stage design — and a scratch-isolated verify-opencode-live-parity.sh harness scaffold that registers cairn-memory as a real local MCP server.
- Extended the harness with all four remaining live stages, fixed a genuine memory-capture.ts crash (broken stdin-writer path) and a genuine opencode-run process-exit race via an opencode-serve/--attach harness pattern, and discovered a live-model reliability gap in read-oriented MCP tool calls that 05-03 must carry forward.
- Authored 05-UAT.md from fresh live-harness runs (discharging OCP-01/02/03/04 from 04-UAT test 2), traced OCP-04's recall read-back gap to qwen3.6-27b-coder's tool-calling (no thinking setting fires both write and read) and then PROVED OCP-04 achievable end-to-end live with a no-thinking tool-call-reliable model (qwen3.5-27b) — the first successful /remember->/recall round-trip in the phase, with reliable headless-harness reproduction the one open item; recorded the interactive TUI session as an explicit D-01 fallback-gap (headless operator, no TTY); and corrected the stale Claude-asset precondition in docs/operating.md.

### Known Gaps (override closeout)

- **OCP-06 — reliable headless reproduction of the `/remember`→`/recall` round-trip. RESOLVED by OCP-07 / Phase 13.** The full round-trip is **proven achievable** — demonstrated once live with a no-thinking, tool-call-reliable local model (qwen3.5-27b), the first successful round-trip in the phase — but not reliably reproducible in the scripted headless harness. Root cause is an opencode run-completion flakiness (undici↔server, model-independent) plus local thinking-model tool-call variance, **not** a defect in `recall.md`/`remember.md`/`cairn-memory`/the harness. The injection, capture, and write mechanisms are each proven live with structurally-trustworthy evidence. **Closed in Phase 13** by converting the round-trip stage to the `opencode serve`/`--attach` transport, upgrading its assertions to genuine `tool_use` NDJSON-event matching (canary-linked), and adding a `--repeat 5` soak mode to `scripts/verify-opencode-live-parity.sh` that reproduces the round-trip 5/5 consecutive times from a fresh scratch environment each run; the per-run and aggregate evidence is recorded in the Phase 13 UAT/VERIFICATION doc.
- **OCP-06 — interactive TUI session not run.** The literal live-session bar (D-01) required a human at a real terminal; the resolving operator was headless with no TTY. Recorded as an explicit D-01 fallback-gap in `05-UAT.md` Test 5 — never claimed as passed. Left for a future operator with an interactive terminal to close if desired. **Still open** — out of scope for OCP-07 (REQUIREMENTS.md); not resolved by Phase 13.

**Follow-up carried forward:** verify each stage with a genuine `"type":"tool"` event in the opencode `--format json` stream rather than a substring grep (a discovered false-positive class where narrated-but-unexecuted tool syntax matches); and re-confirm the round-trip interactively once a TTY operator is available or a reliably tool-calling local model is the default. **Discharged for the round-trip stage by Phase 13 (OCP-07):** the shorthand `"type":"tool"` above refers to the nested `part.type == "tool"` field — the harness's actual parser filters on the top-level envelope field `type == "tool_use"`. The interactive-TUI re-confirmation remains open (see above).

## v1.0 OSS core → parity (Shipped: 2026-07-03)

**Phases completed:** 3 phases (pre-plan-tracking; no SUMMARY.md artifacts)
**Requirements:** 6/6 satisfied (verified by `v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`)
**Baseline tag:** `v1.0.0` (annotated, at HEAD)
**Closeout:** verified_closeout — build clean, smoke suite passing, no tracked secrets

**Delivered:** The open-source core — `cairn-memory` MCP server, the `cairn` CLI, and the carved operating layer (commands, agents, hooks) — brought to drop-in parity with the originating private workflow.

**Key accomplishments:**

- Provider-neutral core — one `CAIRN_GIT_PROVIDER` key + per-provider operation→tool map; no hardcoded git hosts anywhere in the core (Phase 1)
- `cairn-memory` MCP server — 10 tools on stdio plus opt-in token-gated HTTP; fixed the `memory_read` empty-schema bug (ZodEffects `.refine()` published an empty inputSchema)
- Operating layer verified end-to-end — memory round-trip, remember/recall, memory-sync, wiki (ingest/query/lint), security-audit, and repo-review all exercised against the registered MCP across Claude Code
- SEC-0001 fully closed — memory scope path-traversal guard (kebab-case allowlist + `relative()`-based containment) and opt-in HTTP hardening (fail-closed bearer auth, per-origin CORS, Host/DNS-rebinding validation); regression-tested by `smoke-scope-guard.mjs` + `smoke-http-guard.mjs`
- Fresh-bootstrap parity confirmed and documented — `docs/operating.md` operating guide (setup order, per-command workflow reference, config table); `cairn bootstrap` + `sync-claude-assets.sh` reproduce the operating layer into a scratch root, idempotent re-check clean
- OSS hygiene at sign-off — Apache-2.0 LICENSE, CI (`ci.yml`) building + smoke-testing on push/PR, no tracked secrets, no attribution noise

**Known deferred items:**

- OpenCode memory-wakeup install ordering — the OpenCode plugin reuses the rendered Claude hook and fails open if absent; closed by documenting the Claude-first ordering in `docs/operating.md`. Claude Code remains the complete, verified path.
- Enterprise overlay (private-only, never in this repo) and token-miser integration — carried to future milestones.
